Rewrite the following question to follow the Start in the Middle of the Thought guideline.

Input question:
{question}

Guideline (Start in the Middle of the Thought):

Focus: Make the question feel spontaneous, informal, and natural — like a conversation rather than a formal survey.

Instructions for AI:

Avoid formal or structured openings (e.g., “As a founder, what do you think about…”).

Begin directly with the core question or thought.

Use friendly, casual phrasing that feels like something you’d ask a peer.

Maintain the original topic or intent, but remove unnecessary setup.
