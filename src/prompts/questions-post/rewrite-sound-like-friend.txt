Guideline for Prompt (Sound Like Something You’d Ask a Friend)

Guideline:
- Make the question feel casual, warm, and peer-to-peer.
- Write as if speaking to a friend in a DM or in conversation.
- Use interjections, short pauses, or phrasing that mimics natural speech.
- Keep it relatable, human, and approachable.
- Avoid stiff, formal, or corporate phrasing.

Maintain the original topic or intent while enhancing conversational tone.

❌ Stiff/Corporate: “Please share your top priorities when managing tasks.”

✅ Friendly/Conversational: 
“How do you usually decide what to tackle first?”
“Ever have one of those days where nothing seems to go right? How do you usually handle it?”
"Some days just drag — how do you get yourself motivated?”
