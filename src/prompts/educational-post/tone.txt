Prompt:"pick a tone for that fits this post/skeleton outline but make sure it uses simple words and value is delivered"Hook 
Show a sharp contrast. Lots of signups but zero paying customers. Add a quick image of a very specific niche to stop the scroll.
Reframe
Challenge the idea that a wider audience means more users. Being more specific increases signal and reduces noise.
Core Insight
Define one clear ideal customer. Then choose two to three micro niches within that group. Shape your message around one main buying job. Specific messaging increases relevance.
Supporting Drivers
• Decision job ladder
• Use case micro niche matrix
• Language mirror test
Implication
This prevents vague copy that attracts the wrong users. It improves lead quality, makes conversions clearer, and speeds up validation.
CTA
Stop targeting a generic audience. Choose one ideal customer. Outline two to three micro niches. Rewrite your main message around their buying job.
