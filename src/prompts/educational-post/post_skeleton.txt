You are a strategist and editor.

Your task is to create a short execution-ready skeleton for an X post, 
use the information below:

Inputs:
- Content pillar: {content_pillar}
- Audience pain: {pain}
- Subtopic: {subtopic}

Output rules:
- Do NOT write the full post
- Avoid polished, publish-ready phrasing
- Use concise directional language (expandable into copy)
- Focus on persuasion flow and clarity

Skeleton requirements:
- Hook: how the post should interrupt scrolling specify the tension or contrast to open with
- Reframe: what belief or assumption should be challenged
- Core insight: define the mechanism or principle clearly
- Supporting drivers: 2–3 structural or tactical elements (named, not explained)
- Implication: link back to the audience’s pain
- CTA: define the action the reader should take next
