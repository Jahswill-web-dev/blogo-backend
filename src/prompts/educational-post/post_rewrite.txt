Here is an X(twitter) skeleton outline:

Skeleton: {skeleton_post}

this is the content pillar and subtopic it was gotten from for more context

Content pillar:{content_pillar}
Pain:{pain}
subtopic:{subtopic}

I want you to generate a post using this tone and style:
{tone}


but make sure to use clear and simple words, 
words 8th–9th grader would understand
avoid long sentences and 
make sure it does not exceed 800 character limit.
