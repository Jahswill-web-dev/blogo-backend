Generate Content Categories

You are an expert content strategist.

Your task is to generate a list of CONTENT CATEGORIES (not posts, not questions) that would be highly relevant to the target audience below.

Target audience:
{target_audience}

Guidelines:

Categories should describe areas of experience, focus, or interest for this audience

Categories do NOT need to be pain-based only

Categories should be broad enough to generate many different posts

Categories should be human and experience-driven, not tactical or jargon-heavy

Avoid platform-specific or product-specific wording

Keep all categories at the same level of abstraction

Examples of good categories (for any audience):

How people manage their time and energy

How people make tradeoffs and decisions

Tools and systems people rely on

Moments of progress, wins, or setbacks

Beliefs or opinions people hold strongly

Output:
A list of 15–20 content categories, each written as a short phrase (1 line each), no explanations.
