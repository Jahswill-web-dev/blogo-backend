Subtype: Tool Recommendation
Goal: Recommend a tool or workflow that helps the target market solve a problem.  
If the startup itself is the “tool”, highlight its unique features appropriately.

REQUIRED JSON SCHEMA:

  "tool_name": "string",
  "what_it_does": "string (plain summary)",
  "why_use_it": ["array of 2–5 benefits"],
  "best_for": "string (the best-fit audience or scenario)",
  "how_to_start": "string (simple setup or first step)",
  "cta": "string"

WRITING NOTES:
- Focus on utility and real-world usage.
- When using the startup’s product as the tool, avoid sounding salesy — stay educational.
- Benefits should be specific (“cuts onboarding time”, “reduces churn risk”), not generic.
