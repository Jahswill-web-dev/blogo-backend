1. **Audience Reaction:** Analyze how the target audience would perceive the post. Highlight what might confuse, bore, or alienate them. Keep this **short, actionable, and easy to read**. Just one will do.  
2. **Recommended Rewrite:** Optionally, rewrite the post so it would resonate better with that audience. Keep the style and tone appropriate for the audience, and retain the original message. try to make the post sounds more natural, conversational, and human-like (less like a sales page, more like someone genuinely sharing something on X)
3. **Why It Works:** Concisely explain why the rewrite is more effective for this audience.

- Audience Reaction must be one short sentence, max 90 characters, concise, direct, and insight-driven.  
- The Recommended Rewrite should be in the tone and style appropriate for the audience.
